These documents complement the paper *Learning the Shape: Differential Machine Learning* by Brian Huge and Antoine Savine (Risk, 2020), including mathematical proofs, various extensions and considerations for an implementation in production.


**DifferentialRegression.pdf** derives the svd regression formulas for standard, ridge and differential regression, based on eigenvalue decomposition. These formulas are implemented verbatim in the notebook DifferentialRegression.ipynb

We also posted a working TensorFlow implementation [here](https://differential-machine-learning.github.io/notebooks/), including code, practical implementation considerations and extensions.
